                <p class="text-gray-300 pb-4">I'm a full-stack PHP developer with 8+ years of experience. I've built, optimized, and maintained web applications large and small in Laravel for over 5 of those years.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-300">You can catch me posting regularly on my YouTube channel or on my Dev.to blog where I show off brief tutorials for Laravel apps, Vue sites, and Docker. My GitHub also has a small selection of open source packages specifically for Laravel devs.</p>
